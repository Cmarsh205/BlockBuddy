# BlockBuddy
## Introduction
Introducing BlockBuddy! An app created to help keep track of what Lego sets you own and what ones you would like to purchase. It allows you to search all things Lego, including sets, themes, mini-figures, and much more. Once you find the thing you were searching for, you can then either add it to a completed list to indicate that you already have it or add it to a wishlist so that you know that its something you are looking to purchase.
## Why Make This?
I started collecting Lego sets with my fiance when we started dating at first. I loved the Star Wars sets and she loved the Harry Potter sets. From the start it is easy to remember what you own, but as it quickly grows it becomes very difficult to keep track. Especially in the instance of the Harry Potter castle sets that are all the same colour theme. So I thought to myself that it would be great to have some way of being able to track what we own so we dont purchase duplicates for no need.

Hence why I started this project!

Also created for my first module with GetCoding.
